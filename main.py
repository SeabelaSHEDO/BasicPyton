# FIRST CODING ACTIVITY
#define variable called sold and set it to any boolean value
product_name = "Coke"

#define a variable named quantity and set it to any integer
quantity = 10

#define a variable called price and set it to any float
price = 23.90

#define variable called sold and set it to any boolean value
sold = False

#ACTIVITY 2
# Using Python Math Operators create the following variables:
#
#     c equals a divided by b
#
#     d equals a raised to the power of b
#
#     e equals the remainder of a divided by b
#
#     f equals a multiplied by b

a = 9
b = 2

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE:
c = a / b
d = a ** b
e = a % b
f = a * b

#ACTIVITY 3
#
# ## YOUR CODE STARTS HERE. Replace None with the correct formula!
#
# ## The distance from LA to NYC in miles
# distance_miles = 2806
# ## Distance in Km. 1 mile = 1.609 km
# distance_km = None
#
#
# ## Temperature in degreese Celsius
# temperature_c = 25
# ## The temperature T in degrees Fahrenheit (째F) is equal to the temperature T in degrees Celsius (째C) times 9/5 plus 32
# ## Temperature in Fahrenheit
# temperature_f = None
#
# ## Size in inch
# inch = 17
# ## 1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters
# ## Size in cm
# cm = None
#
# ## 1 Year has 365 days, 1 day has 24h, 1h has 3600 sec
# year_in_seconds = None

## YOUR CODE STARTS HERE. Replace None with the correct formula!

## The distance from LA to NYC in miles
distance_miles = 2806
## Distance in Km. 1 mile = 1.609 km
distance_km = distance_miles * 1.609


## Temperature in degreese Celsius
temperature_c = 25
## The temperature T in degrees Fahrenheit (째F) is equal to the temperature T in degrees Celsius (째C) times 9/5 plus 32
## Temperature in Fahrenheit
temperature_f = 25 * (9 / 5) + 32

## Size in inch
inch = 17
## 1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters
## Size in cm
cm = inch * 2.54

## 1 Year has 365 days, 1 day has 24h, 1h has 3600 sec
year_in_seconds = 365 * 24 * 3600
