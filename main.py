# FIRST CODING ACTIVITY
#define variable called sold and set it to any boolean value
product_name = "Coke"

#define a variable named quantity and set it to any integer
quantity = 10

#define a variable called price and set it to any float
price = 23.90

#define variable called sold and set it to any boolean value
sold = False

#ACTIVITY 2
# Using Python Math Operators create the following variables:
#
#     c equals a divided by b
#
#     d equals a raised to the power of b
#
#     e equals the remainder of a divided by b
#
#     f equals a multiplied by b

a = 9
b = 2

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE:
c = a / b
d = a ** b
e = a % b
f = a * b
