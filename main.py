# FIRST CODING ACTIVITY

# define variable called sold and set it to any boolean value
product_name = "Coke"

# define a variable named quantity and set it to any integer
quantity = 10

# define a variable called price and set it to any float
price = 23.90

# define variable called sold and set it to any boolean value
sold = False

# ACTIVITY 2
# Using Python Math Operators create the following variables:
#
#     c equals a divided by b
#
#     d equals a raised to the power of b
#
#     e equals the remainder of a divided by b
#
#     f equals a multiplied by b

a = 9
b = 2

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE:
c = a / b
d = a ** b
e = a % b
f = a * b

# ACTIVITY 3
#
# ## YOUR CODE STARTS HERE. Replace None with the correct formula!
#
# ## The distance from LA to NYC in miles
# distance_miles = 2806
# ## Distance in Km. 1 mile = 1.609 km
# distance_km = None
#
#
# ## Temperature in degrees Celsius
# temperature_c = 25
# The temperature T in degrees Fahrenheit (째F) is equal to the temperature T in degrees Celsius (째C) times 9/5 plus 32
# ## Temperature in Fahrenheit
# temperature_f = None
#
# ## Size in inch
# inch = 17
# ## 1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters
# ## Size in cm
# cm = None
#
# ## 1 Year has 365 days, 1 day has 24h, 1h has 3600 sec
# year_in_seconds = None
